### License/Terms of Use: <br>

MIT-0 <br>

## Use Case: <br>

Developers, analysts, and agents use this skill to retrieve SEC EDGAR XBRL financial statements for US-listed companies by company name, ticker, alias, or CIK. It supports tabular review, JSON output, and optional PDF report generation. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>

Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>

Risk: The security scan reports that the network helper silently weakens HTTPS checks if normal secure fetching fails. <br>
Mitigation: Review or patch the network helper before installing; remove the insecure TLS fallback or require an explicit debug opt-in. <br>
Risk: The skill can produce financial data that users may rely on for financial decisions. <br>
Mitigation: Treat outputs as data retrieval results for review, not financial advice; verify material figures against authoritative SEC filings before making decisions. <br>
Risk: The documented PDF dependency installation uses a system-wide pip flag. <br>
Mitigation: Install reportlab in a virtual environment instead of modifying system Python packages. <br>
